# challenge-week1

In this challenge I was given sloppy code with no semantics, no comments, and unorganized CSS. My goal was to fix that. I successfully cleaned the code up by fixing the indentation, adding comments, changing semantics, etc.

Overall, because I followed along the modules closely, I didn't find this assignment too challenging. That being said I still learned a lot by playing with code given to me and it reinforced topics that I was just taught.
